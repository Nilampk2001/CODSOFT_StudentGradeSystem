# CODSOFT_StudentGradeSystem

This project involves creating a program in Java that calculates and displays the total marks, average percentage, and grade based on the marks obtained by a student in various subjects.

Key functionalities include:

Input Marks: The program prompts the user to enter the marks obtained out of 100 in each subject.

Calculate Total Marks: It sums up the marks obtained across all subjects.

Calculate Average Percentage: The program computes the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects.

Grade Assignment: Based on the calculated average percentage, the program assigns a grade (e.g., A, B, C).

Display Results: Finally, the program displays the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.
